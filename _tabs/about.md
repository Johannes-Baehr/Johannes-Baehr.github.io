# Hey ðŸ‘‹

My name is Johannes, and I'm from Germany.

I've done some web development in the past, but I'm now learning rust, and I want to know more about low-level programming and hardware.
I'm also interested in cybersecurity and ethical hacking, and I sometimes  analyze some malware samples I get from friends or find randomly on the internet.
